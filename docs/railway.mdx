title: Deploy on Railway
---

Deploy OpenClaw on Railway with a one-click template and finish setup in your browser.
This is the easiest "no terminal on the server" path: Railway runs the Gateway for you,
and you configure everything via the `/setup` web wizard.

## Quick checklist (new users)

1. Click **Deploy on Railway** (below).
2. Add a **Volume** mounted at `/data`.
3. Set the required **Variables** (at least `SETUP_PASSWORD`).
4. Enable **HTTP Proxy** on port `8080`.
5. Open `https://<your-railway-domain>/setup` and finish the wizard.

## One-click deploy

  Deploy on Railway
</a>

After deploy, find your public URL in **Railway → your service → Settings → Domains**.

Railway will either:

- give you a generated domain (often `https://<something>.up.railway.app`), or
- use your custom domain if you attached one.

Then open:

- `https://<your-railway-domain>/setup` — setup wizard (password protected)
- `https://<your-railway-domain>/openclaw` — Control UI

## What you get

- Hosted OpenClaw Gateway + Control UI
- Web setup wizard at `/setup` (no terminal commands)
- Persistent storage via Railway Volume (`/data`) so config/credentials/workspace survive redeploys
- Backup export at `/setup/export` to migrate off Railway later
- Automatic cloud environment detection for proper network binding

## Required Railway settings

### Public Networking

Enable **HTTP Proxy** for the service.

- Port: `8080`

### Volume (required)

Attach a volume mounted at:

- `/data`

### Variables

Set these variables on the service:

#### Required

- `SETUP_PASSWORD` (required) — Protects the /setup web UI
- `PORT=8080` (required) — Must match the port in Public Networking

#### Recommended

- `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/data/.openclaw` — Where config and state are stored
- `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR=/data/workspace` — Where workspace files are stored
- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` — Admin secret for gateway authentication (auto-generated if not set)

#### Telegram Security (Highly Recommended)

For security, Telegram DMs default to **pairing mode** (not open). To allow specific users:

- `TELEGRAM_DM_POLICY=pairing` (default, recommended) — Requires pairing code for DMs
- `TELEGRAM_ALLOW_FROM='["@yourusername"]'` — JSON array of allowed Telegram usernames

**Example: Allow only `@johnsonsun`:**
```
TELEGRAM_DM_POLICY=pairing
TELEGRAM_ALLOW_FROM='["@johnsonsun"]'
```

**To allow anyone (NOT recommended for production):**
```
TELEGRAM_DM_POLICY=open
TELEGRAM_ALLOW_FROM='["*"]'
```

**Note:** When using pairing mode, you'll need to approve pairing requests via the setup UI at `/setup`.

## Network Architecture

Railway deployments use a **wrapper + gateway** architecture:

- **Wrapper** (port 8080): HTTP server that provides the /setup UI and proxies requests
- **Gateway** (port 18789): OpenClaw gateway that handles agent communication
- Cloud auto-detection: Gateway automatically binds to `0.0.0.0` (lan mode) in Railway/cloud environments for proper connectivity

This architecture ensures:
- Secure local binding in local/development environments
- Public accessibility in cloud environments
- Easy setup via web UI without SSH access

## Setup flow

1. Visit `https://<your-railway-domain>/setup` and enter your `SETUP_PASSWORD`.
2. Choose a model/auth provider and paste your key.
3. (Optional) Add Telegram/Discord/Slack tokens.
4. Click **Run setup**.

If Telegram DMs are set to pairing, the setup wizard can approve the pairing code.

## Getting chat tokens

### Telegram bot token

1. Message `@BotFather` in Telegram
2. Run `/newbot`
3. Copy the token (looks like `123456789:AA...`)
4. Paste it into `/setup`

### Discord bot token

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. **New Application** → choose a name
3. **Bot** → **Add Bot**
4. **Enable MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** under Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents (required or the bot will crash on startup)
5. Copy the **Bot Token** and paste into `/setup`
6. Invite the bot to your server (OAuth2 URL Generator; scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`)

## Security Best Practices

1. **Always set SETUP_PASSWORD** to protect the setup UI
2. **Use TELEGRAM_DM_POLICY=pairing** (default) instead of "open"
3. **Specify TELEGRAM_ALLOW_FROM** with your specific username(s)
4. **Set a strong OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN** for gateway authentication
5. **Use Railway's environment variable encryption** for sensitive tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway unreachable

If you see "Gateway unreachable" errors:

1. Check that Railway has assigned and exposed port 8080
2. Verify `PORT=8080` environment variable is set
3. Ensure the service is running (check Railway logs)
4. Gateway auto-detects cloud environment via `RAILWAY_*` env vars

### Telegram bot not responding

1. Verify `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` is set correctly
2. Check that MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT is enabled in Discord Dev Portal
3. If using pairing mode, approve pairing code via `/setup` UI
4. Check bot token hasn't been revoked in @BotFather

## Backups & migration

Download a backup at:

- `https://<your-railway-domain>/setup/export`

This exports your OpenClaw state + workspace so you can migrate to another host without losing config or memory.
